    "  * Before the matchups begin, there will be an **elimination round** where we will test your A-Agent against a hidden set of questions. The teams' A-Agents that scores the highest on these seeding questions will move onto the elimination stage. \n",
    "* Like in cricket, each match has two innings:\n",
    "    -   1st inning:\n",
    "        *   $N$ Question from the Q-agent (Team-A) and their corresponding $N$ answers from the A-agent (Team-B).\n",
    "        *   Q-agent score (Team-A): Say, $40$\n",
    "        *   A-agent score (Team-B): $60$\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   2nd inning:\n",

    "        *   A-agent score (Team-A): $30$\n",
    "    -   Final Score:\n",
    "        *   Team-A score $=$ 1st inning Q-agent score $+$ 2nd inning A-agent score $= 40 + 30 = 70$\n",
    "        *   Team-B score $=$ 1st inning A-agent score $+$ 2nd inning Q-agent score $= 60 + 70 = 130$\n",
