{"topic": "Mixed Alphanumeric Series", "question": "If a, 8,?, 17, 23, 29, are all terms in an A.P. then find the missing term in the series with the given number 9 in place of?", "choices": ["A) 9", "B) 14", "C) 18", "D) 22"], "answer": "B", "explanation": "We are given an A.P. a, 8,?, 17, 23, 29. First we need to find the common difference of the series. To find the common difference we subtract any term by its preceding term. Let's find the common difference between 8 and? and the common difference between? and 17. We find the common difference between 8 and? as (17-?) = 9-? and the common difference between? and 17 as 9-? = 4. We get two equations, 17-? = 9-? and 9-? = 4. Solving the first equation, we get? = 8. Solving the second equation we also get? = 5. So the missing number is 5. But our question says that the number 9 should replace the? in the series. So, in the series we have to put 9 in place of? and then find the next term. We get the A.P. as a, 8, 9, 17, 23, 29. Now, we find the common difference of the A.P. The common difference is 9-8=1. The next term in the A.P. is 9 + 1 = 10."}

What is the next letter in the series?", "choices": ["A) G", "B) I", "C) J", "D) L"], "answer": "A", "explanation": "The pattern is that each subset's first letter is the previous subset's last letter plus one, and the last letter is the previous subset's first letter plus one.
